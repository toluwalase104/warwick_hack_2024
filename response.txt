Based on the information provided, the order of donors who best match the benefactor's needs would be:

1. Donor 1
2. Donor 2

The reasoning is as follows:

Benefactor's Needs:
- Food
- Clothes

Donor 1's Offerings:
- Food
- Clothes

Donor 2's Offerings:
- Shelter
- First Aid

Donor 1 is the best match because they can provide the exact items the benefactor needs (food and clothes). Donor 2, while offering different items (shelter and first aid), does not meet the specific needs mentioned by the benefactor.

Therefore, the order of the donor IDs is:

1. Donor 1
2. Donor 2
