# Disaster Relief Community Coordination Platform

## Problem Statement

In the wake of natural disasters and crises, affected communities often face challenges in securing immediate and reliable resources such as food, shelter, medical assistance, and essential supplies. Government resources, while helpful, may be limited in scope and response time, leaving gaps that are often filled by charities and community-driven efforts. However, without proper organization and coordination, these grassroots efforts can be fragmented and inefficient.

Our platform addresses this issue by leveraging AI to curate, sort, and present community-driven resources and requests, streamlining support efforts for disaster management.

## Core Idea

### Story

In times of disaster, those affected face overwhelming challenges. Limited government support, logistical hurdles, and strained infrastructure amplify the need for timely aid. Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram often become hubs for resource-sharing, with individuals and communities offering help. Yet, without a structured platform to coordinate efforts, resources may go underutilized, and victims may struggle to find the aid they urgently need.

This project proposes a solution to enhance the effectiveness of community-driven disaster relief. By creating an AI-powered platform, we aim to:

- Facilitate clear communication between those in need and those offering assistance.
- Optimize the allocation of resources by connecting requests with available supplies.
- Provide an organized, transparent view of ongoing relief efforts, empowering communities to manage resources more efficiently.

### Platform Overview

1. **Victim Requests**:
   - Individuals in affected areas submit requests for essential resources (e.g., food, shelter, medical supplies).
   - Requests are tagged with location and urgency level (from green to red) to prioritize response efforts.

2. **Community Resources**:
   - Local communities, organizations, and individuals can submit available resources or services they wish to offer.
   - Resources are categorized and matched with incoming requests.

### Additional Features

- **Donation Portal**:
  - For those outside the affected area, a dedicated page lists major charities and organizations, offering convenient donation options to support relief efforts.

- **Real-Time Communication**:
  - Once a resource match is found, the platform notifies both parties (victim and provider) using SMTP-based messaging for fast, reliable communication.

- **Statistic Tracker**:
  - To provide an overview of resource allocation, the number of people helped, and ongoing needs within affected communities.
  - Enables transparency and helps identify resource gaps and areas needing more support.

- **Community Calendar**:
  - To keep track of scheduled relief efforts, community events, and local support activities.
  - Helps victims and volunteers stay informed about upcoming events, such as distribution days or health camps.

- **Advice Library**:
  - A collection of guidance links to support you in preparing for and managing disasters.

- **Disaster Charity Library**:
  - A curated list of reputable charities and non-profits dedicated to disaster relief and recovery.

- **Real-time GPS Resources**:
   - Use a users address and required resource type, which is geocoded to find nearby resources.
   - A map centers on the user's location, showing markers for available resources within a specified radius.

- **Feedback Form**:
  - A space for users to share their feedback to developers.
  - Supports continuous improvement and builds user trust.
