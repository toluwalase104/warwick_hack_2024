# Disaster Relief Community Coordination Platform

## Problem Statement

In the wake of natural disasters and crises, affected communities often face challenges in securing immediate and reliable resources such as food, shelter, medical assistance, and essential supplies. Government resources, while helpful, may be limited in scope and response time, leaving gaps that are often filled by charities and community-driven efforts. However, without proper organization and coordination, these grassroots efforts can be fragmented and inefficient.

Our platform addresses this issue by leveraging AI to curate, sort, and present community-driven resources and requests, streamlining support efforts for disaster management.

## Core Idea

### Story

In times of disaster, those affected face overwhelming challenges. Limited government support, logistical hurdles, and strained infrastructure amplify the need for timely aid. Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram often become hubs for resource-sharing, with individuals and communities offering help. Yet, without a structured platform to coordinate efforts, resources may go underutilized, and victims may struggle to find the aid they urgently need.

This project proposes a solution to enhance the effectiveness of community-driven disaster relief. By creating an AI-powered platform, we aim to:

- Facilitate clear communication between those in need and those offering assistance.
- Optimize the allocation of resources by connecting requests with available supplies.
- Provide an organized, transparent view of ongoing relief efforts, empowering communities to manage resources more efficiently.

### Platform Overview

1. **Victim Requests**:
   - Individuals in affected areas submit requests for essential resources (e.g., food, shelter, medical supplies).
   - Requests are tagged with location and urgency level (from green to red) to prioritize response efforts.

2. **Community Resources**:
   - Local communities, organizations, and individuals can submit available resources or services they wish to offer.
   - Resources are categorized and matched with incoming requests.

3. **AI-Driven Coordination**:
   - An AI agent curates, sorts, and matches requests with available resources.
   - The AI arranges solutions by urgency, proximity, and availability, enabling faster, more efficient response times.

### Additional Features

- **AI Chatbot**:
  - An interactive chatbot assists victims by guiding them through request submission and providing immediate information on available resources or nearby aid centers.

- **Donation Portal**:
  - For those outside the affected area, a dedicated page lists major charities and organizations, offering convenient donation options to support relief efforts.

- **Real-Time Communication**:
  - Once a resource match is found, the platform notifies both parties (victim and provider) using SMTP-based messaging for fast, reliable communication.

### Development Outline

1. **Request System**:
   - Users can submit and track requests for aid or resource contributions through a web or mobile interface.
   - Requests are stored in a database, updated with real-time status.

2. **Database Integration**:
   - Centralized database management to handle all requests, available resources, and response updates.
   - The AI agent regularly communicates with the database, providing a live tracker of ongoing relief efforts.

3. **Live Tracker**:
   - A map visualizing current disaster zones, active requests, and available resources.
   - Real-time statistics on the number of requests fulfilled, pending requests, and available resources.

4. **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Graphical displays track progress and impact, helping users visualize the relief efforts.
   - Insights on demand and supply of resources to aid in decision-making for future disaster response.

5. **Web Page with Major Charities**:
   - Dedicated page listing verified charities and disaster relief organizations for secure donations.

6. **Real-time GPS Resources**:
   - User Location and Resource Query: Users input their address and desired resource type, which is geocoded and queried for nearby resources.
   - Map Visualization: A map centers on the userâ€™s location, displaying markers for available resources within a set radius.

This platform is designed to empower communities in times of crisis by facilitating resource sharing, connecting people in need with those able to help, and enhancing the efficiency and transparency of relief efforts. With AI-driven matching and live tracking, we aim to bridge the gap between needs and resources, ensuring swift and effective disaster response.
